# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is tool that allows developers to view the entire history of revisions/changes to directories and files. It is useful because it allows developers to track progress, review changes made by different people, revert back to a previous “version” and in essence back up their code
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of my project where modifications can be made without altering the main set of files (the overall project or master branch) until I am ready to “commit” to those changes. I would use a branch if I am working on a project on a team or more than one person and I don't want to worry about sudden changes in the "codebase."
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is a save point in Git (version control program) commit messages give you an idea of what was changed since the last save point for future reference they should be as detailed as needed in order to understand what changes were made
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur when a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file; the conflict being that you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit.
