What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semenatic tags give the HTML document structure/organization and "meaning" - they do not provide any stylistic qualities or alter the look of the document. The tag I found most useful for adding organization to my document is the <section> tag - it help define sections that make it easy to navigate when filtering through code and editing.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser processes and loads elements in the order in which I place them on my HTML document - therefore, top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Although, maybe not entirely relevant, but sublime related, I learned how to properly indent my HTML document and that when I do so, sublime creates these convenient drop down arrows that allow me to collapse certain elements to thus shorter my code and allow me to focus on specific areas instead of scrolling through lines on lines on lines. Snippets also were a pretty life changing and time saving concept and I will definitely be creating more snippets in the future!


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
The only challenging part is not only understanding when/why each semantic tag is traditionally used, but also remembering to actually use the tags. It's easy to just start writing code and forget to use them. It would improve my understanding of their concept and their usefulness if I created a snippet that included some of the major/common ones and used it as a basic outline for every HTML document I create. Similar to in this Release, it helped create organization to my document (and my mind!!) when each element was already listed; encouraging me to plan ahead and think about what information I need to include and what information I don't need to include.
